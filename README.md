# WineQuality-Supervised-ML-Algo
Combination of all the supervised multiclass Classification algorithms 
consist of :

Support Vector Machine

 K-Neighbors
 
 Naive Bayes
 
 Random Forest
 
 Decision Trees
 
 Prediction is done based on the quality not on the type of wine so you can change the code according to your need
 
 I will add more supervised classification algorithm in the future
